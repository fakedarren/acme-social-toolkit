This has two main parts - the server, which handles the share and redirect, and the client, which is the toolkit UI.

The server is node and express.

The client is React.

Configuration is set with json files and environment variables, so you do not need a database.

This app uses *two* subdomains that point at the same codebase. One is for the shares and redirects, the other for the toolkit itself.
